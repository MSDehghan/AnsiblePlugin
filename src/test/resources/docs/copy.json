Use the 'fetch' module to copy files from remote locations to the local box. If you need variable interpolation in copied files, use the 'template' module. Using a variable in the 'content' field will result in unpredictable output. For Windows targets, use the 'win_copy' module instead.","notes":"The 'copy' module recursively copy facility does not scale to lots (>hundreds) of files.","fields":{"owner":{"description":"Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to 'chown'.","type":"str"},"backup":{"description":"Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.","type":"bool","versionAdded":"0.7","defaultValue":"false"},"directory_mode":{"description":"When doing a recursive copy set the mode for the directories. If this is not set we will use the system defaults. The mode is only set on directories which are newly created, and will not affect those that already existed.","type":"raw","versionAdded":"1.5"},"src":{"description":"Local path to a file to copy to the remote server. This can be absolute or relative. If path is a directory, it is copied recursively. In this case, if path ends with \"/\", only inside contents of that directory are copied to destination. Otherwise, if it does not end with \"/\", the directory itself with all contents is copied. This behavior is similar to the 'rsync' command line tool.","type":"path"},"serole":{"description":"The role part of the SELinux file context. When set to '_default', it will use the 'role' portion of the policy if available.","type":"str"},"dest":{"description":"Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to. If 'src' is a directory, this must be a directory too. If 'dest' is a non-existent path and if either 'dest' ends with \"/\" or 'src' is a directory, 'dest' is created. If 'dest' is a relative path, the starting directory is determined by the remote host. If 'src' and 'dest' are files, the parent directory of 'dest' is not created and the task fails if it does not already exist.","required":true,"type":"path"},"follow":{"description":"This flag indicates that filesystem links in the destination, if they exist, should be followed.","type":"bool","versionAdded":"1.8","defaultValue":"false"},"content":{"description":"When used instead of 'src', sets the contents of a file directly to the specified value. Works only when 'dest' is a file. Creates the file if it does not exist. For advanced formatting or if 'content' contains a variable, use the 'template' module.","type":"str","versionAdded":"1.1"},"setype":{"description":"The type part of the SELinux file context. When set to '_default', it will use the 'type' portion of the policy if available.","type":"str"},"mode":{"description":"The permissions of the destination file or directory. For those used to '/usr/bin/chmod' remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like '0644' or '01777')or quote it (like ''644'' or ''1777'') so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number. Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results. As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, 'u+rwx' or 'u=rw,g=r,o=r'). As of Ansible 2.3, the mode may also be the special string 'preserve'. 'preserve' means that the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.","type":"path"},"selevel":{"description":"The level part of the SELinux file context. This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the 'range'. When set to '_default', it will use the 'level' portion of the policy if available.","type":"str","defaultValue":"\"s0\""},"unsafe_writes":{"description":"Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target file. By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted files, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the container and can only be written in an unsafe manner. This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files when atomic operations fail (however, it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes). IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption.","type":"bool","versionAdded":"2.2","defaultValue":"false"},"checksum":{"description":"SHA1 checksum of the file being transferred. Used to validate that the copy of the file was successful. If this is not provided, ansible will use the local calculated checksum of the src file.","type":"str","versionAdded":"2.5"},"local_follow":{"description":"This flag indicates that filesystem links in the source tree, if they exist, should be followed.","type":"bool","versionAdded":"2.4","defaultValue":"true"},"attributes":{"aliases":["attr"],"description":"The attributes the resulting file or directory should have. To get supported flags look at the man page for 'chattr' on the target system. This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by 'lsattr'.

If 'yes', the remote file will be replaced when contents are different than the source. If 'no', the file will only be transferred if the destination does not exist.

If 'no', it will search for 'src' at originating/master machine. If 'yes' it will go to the remote/target machine for the 'src'. 'remote_src' supports recursive copying as of version 2.8.
